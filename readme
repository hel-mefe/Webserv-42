/***
These are some special conventions to collaborate flawlessly

Structs
- Always named with camelStyle (small letter at the beginning then Capital letter for words inside it)

Classes
- Always named with PascalCase (Capital Letter at the beginning and each word is starting with Capital as well)


Each class focusses on one proper problem and solves it optimally (nearly-optimal if not optimal)


Structure of the program is as follows


        -----> ConfigFileParser (class that parses the config file)

WebServ ----> globalHttpConfigs    (struct)     

        -----> Vector<Server> Servers (vector of classes)

And each Server is a class that has the following attributes:

-------> servAttributes (struct)

-------> HashMap<string, locationConfigs> (location, struct)

-------> RequestHandler (class that will handle all the requests from parsing to preparing the data to the response builder)

-------> ResponseHandler (class that will handle the responses)

(LogicalSide) RequestHandler is a class that will handle everything about the requests from parsing them
to preparing the data for the ResponseBuilder class, here where all the work should be put

(NetworkingSide) ResponseHandler -> as long as the RequestHandler will prepare the data for this class then
the main work for this class is just serving the clients, or we can say Networking side
